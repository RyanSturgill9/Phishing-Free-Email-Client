# Phishing Free Email Client 
###### By: Ryan Sturgill

### Todo List:
+ Connect the Gmail API to the GitHub
+ Get a website created for the system to run (at least the preview for it)
+ Get a file preview system and info page
+ AI detection tool setup and running
+ Website previewing area
+ Common website checker (checks to see if its a common website name like "facebook.com" and makes sure that it is the real link and not one that just looks like it) (maybe the user enters in the website that it says it is and then it goes to see if those websites match up)
